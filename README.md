### CSV_Extract_Tool

  Recently,I tried to extract the specified information from the CSV files exported by the OneForAll, a subdomain search tool, but the manual extraction was a waste of time and effort , so  I created this tool that can automatically extract the column whose first row's value matches the keyword you input and save these information as a file in txt format.
  The following are the instructions:
    1.Select file(s):  This tool can select one file or multiple files at a time. Just click the corresponding button on the right side of first edit-line according to your own needs.
    2.Input the keyword: Input the keyword you want to extract in the second edit-line.
    3.After input, just click the Extract button, and the tool will save the information you want to extract in the TXT format file.
  By the way, if you don't have the corresponding python libraries, you can simply run the CSV_Extract.exe, which has the same functionality.
  The following figure shows the operations:
